Most developers who are using this documentation will use the api projection.

Note that if you use this parameter when requesting a standard feed, then YouTube will retrieve the standard feed and then filter the response to only include videos uploaded by the specified author. For example, if you request the \"Top Rated\" feed for user GoogleDevelopers, the API will retrieve the top-rated feed and return a response containing videos in that feed uploaded by user GoogleDevelopers. The API will not return a list of that user's videos ordered by rating. In a request for a user activity feed, the author parameter contains a comma-separated list of up to 20 YouTube usernames. The API response will contain activities performed by any of those users."},"callback":{"doc":"The callback parameter identifies the callback function to which the API response will be sent.

This parameter is required if the value of the alt parameter is json-in-script."},"field":{"doc":"The fields parameter serves one or both of the following purposes:It identifies the data fields that should be included in a partial API response.It specifies conditions that should be used to filter the result set.The parameter value is formatted using a syntax inspired by XPath as described in the Formatting the fields parameter value section. That section also explains how conditions specified in the parameter value are applied since the API handles filters identified in the fields parameter value differently than filters identified in other query parameters, such as the category or q parameters."},"fields-language":{"doc":"The fields-language parameter is being used temporarily to force the API server to apply new syntax rules affecting requests to retrieve partial API responses. The rules determine whether a tag's text content is returned in a partial response. They also let you filter results based on the presence of an element that does not contain text content. For example, you could retrieve all entries containing the 'app:control' tag, which has subtags but does not contain text content. The new rules are explained in detail in the release notes for August 31, 2010.To use the new syntax rules for partial API responses, or to filter results based on the presence of an element that does not contain text content, set the fields-language parameter value to r2.

For example, to request the second set of 10 results – i.e. results 11-20 – set the max-results parameter to 10 and the start-index parameter to 11. The default value of this parameter is 25, and the maximum value is 50.

The default behavior is to return content that is viewable worldwide.Important: You must specify a region parameter value if you want a movie chart to include rental (paid-content) videos. If you do not specify a value for this parameter, the chart will only contain movies that are viewable worldwide. Since each video rental offer specifies the country where the offer is valid, YouTube can only determine whether a user could potentially view a rental video if an API request specifies the country where the user is located. Since there are no rental videos that are accessible worldwide, a chart will be empty if you set the paid-content parameter to true for a movie chart and do not also specify a region parameter value."}}},"deleteMessage":{"doc":"Delete a message in the inbox !","params":{"projection":{"doc":"All API requests must specify a projection.

The parameter can be used in either of the following contexts:The parameter value can specify geographic coordinates (latitude,longitude) that identify a particular location. In this context, the location parameter operates in conjunction with the location-radius parameter to define a geographic area. The API response will then contain videos that are associated with a geographical location within that area.Note that when a user uploads a video to YouTube, the user can associate a location with the video by either specifying geographic coordinates (-122.08427,37.42307) or by providing a descriptive address (Munich, Germany). As such, some videos may be associated with a location within the area specified in a search query even though those videos are not associated with specific coordinates that can be plotted on a map.To exclude videos from the API response if those videos are associated with a descriptive address but not with specific geographic coordinates, append an exclamation point (\"!\") to the end of the parameter value. This practice effectively ensures that all videos in the API response can be plotted on a map.The following examples show sample uses of this parameter:location=37.42307,-122.08427&location-radius=100kmlocation=37.42307,-122.08427!&location-radius=100kmIn an API response, feed entries that are associated with specific coordinates will contain the 'georss:where' tag and may also contain the 'yt:location' tag. Feed entries that are associated with a descriptive address but not with specific geographic cooordinates specify the address using the 'yt:location' tag.The parameter value can be empty or a single exclamation point. In this context, the parameter does not require a value and its presence serves to restrict the search results to videos that have a geographical location, but it does not enable you to find videos with a specific geographical location. This parameter can be used with all video feeds. A video that has a geographical location will have a 'georss:where' tag in its metadata.YouTube supports this parameter for video search requests."},"location-radius":{"doc":"The location-radius parameter, in conjunction with the location parameter, defines a geographic area.

If you do not specify a value for this parameter, the chart will only contain movies that are viewable worldwide. Since each video rental offer specifies the country where the offer is valid, YouTube can only determine whether a user could potentially view a rental video if an API request specifies the country where the user is located.

The parameter value identifies the end user's IP address to the API server. We recommend that you always use this parameter to specify the end user's IP address. However, it is particularly important to set this parameter when a server or middle layer in your application stack uses the API on the end user's behalf and also sends all of the API requests on the user's behalf. This case usually applies to website applications that use the API.If you do not set the restriction parameter value, then the API server might apply country restrictions incorrectly. For example, it might base restrictions on your middle-layer server's location rather than on the end user's actual location.
