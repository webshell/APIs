Gravatar API
============

Gravatar is a web service that lets users create profiles and avatars called Gravatars. A Gravatar is an image that follows you from site to site appearing beside your name when you do things like comment or post on a blog. Gravatar has several developer services that do not require application authentication (although to edit user information in XML-RPC a user must be authenticated).
