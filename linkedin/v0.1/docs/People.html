			<td>company-name</td>
			<td>Members who have a matching company name on their profile. company-name can be combined with the current-company<br/>					parameter to specifies whether the person is or is not still working at the company. It's often valuable to not be too<br/>					specific with the company name. LinkedIn has made great efforts at standardizing company names, but including suffixes<br/>					such as "Inc" and "Company" may overly limit your search, missing people who did not include those suffixes on their<br/>					company names. It's usually better to search for the basic name of the company and all different versions will be<br/>					returned. This does increase the possibility of a false positive match return, though, so consider the most specific<br/>					terms you can use. For example, consider using "Acme" instead of "Acme, Inc" to find people from a company called Acme,<br/>					Inc. But this runs the risk of finding people from different companies with Acme in the title, such as "Acme Vending"<br/>					and "Acme Services".<br/>			</td>
