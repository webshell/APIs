<h3>company-search</h3>
<p>Use the Company Search API to find companies using keywords, industry, location, or some other criteria. It returns a collection of matching companies. Each entry can contain much of the information available on the company page.<br/><br/>The API can also return facets. Facets provide you with data about the collection of companies, such as which companies are located in a certain area, size of the companies, and the industry a company is in. You can then use this data to make a new API call that further refines your original request. This is similar to clicking the buttons on the left-hand side of the LinkedIn Search results page.<br/>			</p>
